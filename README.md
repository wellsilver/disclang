.dss means "Discord Something Something"
It is meant to be a language that you can use to make simple responses for people who are either too lazy, or dont know how to code.
:: For example, this is a note, earlier you saw a multi-line note. Wich you can do via ::numberoflines
though we dont actually need notes its better to use them

:: Now that we are done with that, here we have a simple response message
:> Hello >>> World!
:: This is a reply message
;> Hello >>> World!
:: And this responds with a emoji
;> I like genshin impact >>> :grave:

:: Theres a few others, like
:> ping me or else >>> Ugh, FINE. ()
:: ^ mentions

--------------------INSTALL (windows)---------------------
If your on windows you can download python by going into powershell and typing in "winget install Python.Python.3" this should also install the command line tool "pip" open command line this time, not powershell, and type in "pip install discord" after it finishes installing you should be good to click on main.py then choose the file to compile, remember it doesnt append to the end of filenames so you need to do it yourself. EG, instead of "mydiscordbot" when prompted you type "mydiscordbot.py", then you close it after it says "Done!" and open your file
